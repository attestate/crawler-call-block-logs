Extractor module
________________

.. code-block:: javascript

  // NOTE: address and topics can be used to filter events at the Ethereum node
  //  level.
  function init({ args: {start = 0, end, address, topics, blockspan = 1}})

* ``start`` Start block as a natural number in decimal-base (default: 0).
* ``end`` End block as a natural number in decimal-base.
* ``address`` "0x"- prefixed Ethereum address of where an event log originates
  from.
* ``topics`` Array containing up to three 32 byte long "0x"-prefixed topic
  hashes related to the event or an array of arrays containing such values.
* ``blockspan`` The distance between ``fromBlock`` and ``toBlock`` in decimal-base (default: 1).
* ``includeTimestamp`` Flag to include the block timestamp as ``block.timestamp`` in
  the result object.
* ``includeValue`` Flag to include the transaction's value as
  ``transaction.value`` in the result object.

Transformer module
__________________

.. code-block:: javascript

  function onLine({args: {topics = [], address, inputs}, state: {line}})

* ``line`` Is an argument defined by ``@attestate/crawler`` internally. It is a 
  line within the strategy's ``input.path`` file.
* ``address`` "0x"- prefixed Ethereum address of where an event log originates
  from.
* ``topics`` Array containing up to three 32 byte long "0x"-prefixed topic
  hashes related to the event or an array of arrays containing such values.
* ``inputs`` When defined, it replaces the event log's "data" property with a
  parsed event log using `web3-eth-abi@1.4.0's decodeLog
  <https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.4.0/web3-eth-abi.html#decodelog>`_.

Loader module
_____________

.. code-block:: javascript

  function* order({state: {line}})

* ``line`` Is an argument defined by ``@attestate/crawler`` internally. It is a 
  line within the strategy's ``input.path`` file.

``order`` is a JavaScript `generator function
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*>`_.
As the ``key``, it concatenates serialized ``blockNumber`` and ``transactionIndex`` to
generate an identifier which defines a total order among ``transactionHash``es.
``value`` is the ``transactionHash``.

.. code-block:: javascript

  function* direct({state: {line}})

* ``line`` Is an argument defined by ``@attestate/crawler`` internally. It is a 
  line within the strategy's ``input.path`` file.

``direct`` is a JavaScript `generator function
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*>`_.
As the ``key``, it defines the ``transactionHash`` to generate an identifier
which lets us directly access the log through ``value``.

State module
____________

The state module provides coordinator functionality for continuous blockchain
monitoring by polling ``eth_blockNumber`` over HTTP.

.. code-block:: javascript

  function watch({ environment, onNewBlock })

* ``environment`` Object containing environment variables (``rpcHttpHost``,
  ``pollingInterval``) passed from the crawler configuration.
* ``onNewBlock`` Callback function invoked with the latest block number on
  every poll that sees a new block.

The ``watch()`` function polls ``eth_blockNumber`` on
``environment.rpcHttpHost`` every ``environment.pollingInterval`` milliseconds
and returns an ``unwatch()`` function to stop polling.

``environment.rpcHttpHost`` can be a single URL or a list of URLs. With a list,
each crawl sends its ``eth_getLogs`` requests to the next URL in turn, which
spreads the load across providers (e.g. to stay within several free tiers).

.. note::
   Versions 0.6.x subscribed to ``newHeads`` via WebSocket
   (``environment.rpcWsHost``). Since 0.7.0, ``watch()`` polls over HTTP
   instead, because many providers bill every ``newHeads`` event.
